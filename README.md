# Projet

Improve and refine your previous home work. 
Replace the RDFS schema(s) by OWL ontologies,
introduce SKOS thesaurus (i) as and when it is relevant, add SHACL constraints to your RDF graph(s).

Experiment and explain SPARQL querying with OWL entailment,
consistency checking wrt an OWL ontology, and SHACL constraint checking using short simple extracts taken from your project.

Write a report 
1) explaining the rationale of your model and 
2) explaining OWL entailment,
consistency checking and SHACL constraint checking.
